Code for my videos is in `scripts/`

I build these using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and the [advanced-slides plugin](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides): I take each slide, printscreen it, and splice it with my audio using [reaper.fm](http://reaper.fm/).

In the most recent video I used [Animotion](https://animotion.pages.dev/) to render the slides, to do this go to `slides/` and run `pnpm dev`

# Recommended Effect Reading

Here are some great resources that I used to teach myself:

- The Docs
  https://effect.website/

- The Effect Discord Server
  https://discord.gg/effect-ts

- Effect Introduction
  https://github.com/antoine-coulon/effect-introduction

- Effect Crashcourse
  https://github.com/pigoz/effect-crashcourse

- Introduction to Effect (conference talk)
  https://youtu.be/zrNr3JVUc8I

- Zio (Effect's scala older brother)
  Zio and Effect have a ton of overlap. If there isn't a effect tutorial for something, check if one exists for the same topic in Zio
  - Zio docs: https://zio.dev/
  - Also just search "Zio <topic>" on youtube theres a bunch of content


Have fun, and good luck!
